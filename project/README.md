# Agriwaste Frontend Project

This directory contains the React application built with Vite and TypeScript.

## Core Technologies
- **React**: UI library for building the interface.
- **Vite**: Next-generation frontend tooling and bundler.
- **TypeScript**: Typed superset of JavaScript for robust development.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- **react-router-dom**: Routing for client-side navigation.
- **i18next**: Internationalization framework for multi-language support.
- **Axios**: HTTP client for making API requests to the backend server.
- **Lucide React**: Icon library.

## Scripts
- `npm run dev`: Starts the Vite development server with Hot Module Replacement (HMR).
- `npm run build`: Builds the app into a production-ready bundle in the `dist` directory.
- `npm run lint`: Runs ESLint to check for code quality issues.
- `npm run preview`: Previews the production build locally.

## Components and Pages
- **WeatherAdvisory**: A functional component that queries the local `backend` server to display weather conditions and agricultural advisories.
